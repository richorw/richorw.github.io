生于东方之极东，热衷于东瀛之东方。求学魔都，然后求生。

是个不太安分的人，想要做设计，摄影，编程，做游戏，画漫画，写文章，做翻译，不一而足。

目前设计是第一要务，向专业主义持续发力中。

乐于创造，但首先需要成为一个专业的人。

Born in the end of eastern, loving all about japan. A five-year undergraduate in Journalism school, Fudan University, Shanghai. Have been to Waseda University for one year, and could read and write English and Japanese.

Be eager to do design, photography, programming, indie game, ACG, writing on society, culture and technology, Japanese translating and something else. 

Now focus on design, including graphic design, typography and UI design. Trying to train myself to be professional now. 

Dream of creating great stuff in the future.

まず職人になりましょう。
